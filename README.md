My first README
=====================

The first time I encountered a README file was the first time I purchased a Wordpress template back in 2010. Because the purchase came from _the internet_ and I was _super_ savvy and security conscious, I quietly patted myself on the back for being wise enough not to to fall for ***that*** trick. I mean, including a file that screams 'read me' with typo? Who'd be silly enough to open that and unleash malware onto their computer?  


##About my first computer program

Am I allowed to call it a program? Or is it a web app? Don't judge me. I'd not written a line of code until the week before last (Myspace <img src=''><\> doesn't count. Or maybe it does? I felt pretty clever when I did it in 2006). I digress. This is the first thing I've written in code and can do a thing. It is game. I had much help (Please see thank-yous).

##The game

The game is noughts & crosses (or tic-tac-toe if you're American). It's a two player game where each player is assigned character( X or O) and the players take turns to place their 'X' or 'O' in the nine boxes on the grid. The first player to achieve three of their characters in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins.

#Scope of functionalities 

* Players cannot unselect their character once selected. 
* Character 'X' is Player 1
* Character 'o' is Player 2

##Languages used

* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS
* jQuery

##Thank-you

To [Hugh] (https://github.com/Hughsin23/) for the marathon hand-holding effort. To [Ai] (https://github.com/aibate) and [Kris] (https://github.com/kristabel-wong) for the help, and [Joel] (https://github.com/wofockham/) for not giving me the out to drop out on day 3 of this course.
