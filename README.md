My first README
=====================

The first time I encountered a README file was the first time I purchased a Wordpress template back in 2010. Because the purchase came from _the internet_ and I was _super_ savvy and security conscious, I quietly patted myself on the back for being wise enough not to to fall for ***that*** trick. I mean, including a file that screams 'read me' with typo? Who'd be silly enough to fall for that?
